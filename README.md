Endpoints:
- GET /superhero: Retrieve a list of all superheroes, sorted by their humility score.
- POST /superhero: Create a new superhero with a name, superpower, and humility score.
- 
Technologies:
- NestJS: For building the API.
- TypeScript: For logic.
- Jest: For unit and end-to-end testing.
- ESLint and Prettier: For code linting and formatting.

### Frontend

The frontend application, located in the superhero_api_frontend directory, provides a user interface to interact with the superhero registry. It includes the following features:

Components:
- UseSuperhero: Manages state and side effects for fetching and creating superheroes.

Technologies:
- React: For building the user interface.
- TypeScript: For logic.
- Material-UI: For UI components.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests.
- Vite: For fast development and build tooling.
